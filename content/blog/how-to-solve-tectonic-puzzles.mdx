# How to Solve Tectonic Puzzles: A Beginner's Guide

Welcome to the world of Tectonic puzzles! In this guide, we'll walk through the basic techniques that will help you solve these engaging puzzles.

## What is a Tectonic Puzzle?

A Tectonic puzzle is a logic-based number placement puzzle where you need to fill a grid with numbers following specific rules.

## Basic Rules

1. Fill each region with consecutive numbers starting from 1
2. No number can repeat within a region
3. The same number cannot appear in orthogonally adjacent cells (diagonally adjacent is okay)

## Getting Started

The best way to start solving a Tectonic puzzle is to:

1. Look for small regions first
2. Identify forced placements
3. Use the adjacency rule to your advantage
