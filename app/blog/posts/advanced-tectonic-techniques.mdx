# Advanced Tectonic Techniques

After mastering the basics of Tectonic puzzles, many solvers hit a plateau. This guide will help you break through to the next level with advanced techniques.

## 1. Chain Analysis

One of the most powerful techniques in advanced Tectonic solving is chain analysis. Here's how it works:

```typescript
// Example of a chain in a 4x4 grid
const grid = [
  [1, null, 3, null],
  [null, 2, null, 4],
  [4, null, 1, null],
  [null, 3, null, 2]
];
```

When you see this pattern, you can deduce that:
- If A is true, then B must be true
- If B is true, then C must be true
- If C is true, then A must be false

This creates a contradiction, proving our initial assumption was wrong.

## 2. Region Interaction

Let's examine how different regions interact:

- **Adjacent Regions**: When two regions share a border, they create constraints
- **Overlapping Possibilities**: Sometimes, two regions can't both contain certain numbers
- **Forced Placements**: When all other options are eliminated

### Example Pattern

Here's a common pattern you'll encounter:

```
┌───┬───┬───┐
│ 1 │ 2 │ ? │
├───┼───┼───┤
│ ? │ 3 │ 1 │
└───┴───┴───┘
```

In this case, the '?' in the top right **must** be 3 because:
1. It can't be 1 (already in bottom right)
2. It can't be 2 (already in top middle)
3. Therefore, it must be 3

## Interactive Example

<TectonicGrid 
  puzzle={{
    grid: [
      [1, 2, 0],
      [0, 3, 1]
    ],
    regions: [
      [[0,0], [0,1]],
      [[0,2], [1,2]],
      [[1,0], [1,1]]
    ]
  }}
/>

## Practice Tips

1. **Time yourself**: Track your solving speed to measure improvement
2. **Study patterns**: Keep a notebook of interesting patterns
3. **Challenge yourself**: Try harder puzzles regularly

> 💡 **Pro Tip**: When stuck, take a step back and look at the entire grid. Sometimes the answer is in the bigger picture.
